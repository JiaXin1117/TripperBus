                    <p>The following rules apply to all TripperBus travel. These rules may be changed at any time at our sole
                        discretion without prior notice.</p>

                    <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> We do not offer refunds; however, you can change your trip online up to 12
                        hours prior to your initial departure without any fees.</p>

                    <p>Although we do not issue any refunds, you may bank this purchase into your Tripper account, for use at
                        a later travel date.</p>

                    <p>Five minutes prior to departure, we reserve the right to release your reservation if you have not showed
                        up, notified the manager and/or claimed your seat. We will then make all empty seats available to
                        walk up customers. If you are a no-show, the ticket is forfeited and cannot be rescheduled.</p>

                    <p>We make an effort to provide free WiFi service and power outlets on all buses. If these services are
                        not available no credit will be issued.</p>
